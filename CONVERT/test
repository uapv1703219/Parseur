Abstract. Seven years ago Peter Mika (Yahoo! Research) proposed a
tripartite model of actors, concepts and instances for document repre-
sentation in the study of social networks. We propose a modiﬁed model,
where instead of document authors we consider textual mentions of per-
sons and institutions as actors. This representation proves to be more
appropriate for the solution of a range of Internet Sociology tasks. In the
paper we describe experiments with the modiﬁed model and provide some
background on the tools that can be used to build it. The model is tested
on the experimental corpora of Russian news (educational domain). The
research reﬂects the pilot study ﬁndings.

1 Introduction

The automatic detection of document and corpus topic is one of the most pop-
ular tasks within the natural language processing. The traditional model, where
each document is represented by a vector describing the distribution of keywords
in a document or corpus, works quite well. On the basis of this representation,
it becomes possible to group similar documents and reveal the corpus structure,
as well as to group keywords and build topic vocabularies [6,11]. Considering
each document as an ontology instance and a set of keywords as a concept, we
obtain a two-layer ontology model. The appearance of social networks allowed
the researchers to bring in the social aspect, thus creating a tripartite model
of ontology for Social Networks Analysis containing document authors (actors),
document content (instances), and tags (concepts) [13]. Three-layer model is
a tool for studying the emergence and dynamics of communities on the basis
of user-generated content. Author proﬁling gave an opportunity to analyze the

attitude of diﬀerent user categories towards particular events and topics. How-
ever, it is not only the author’s personality that matters for solving Internet
Sociology tasks, but also the awareness of the connection between the text men-
tions of personalities and organizations and concepts and instances within text.
This knowledge is important, when dealing with traditional mass media - e-
publications created by analysts and journalists. In this case, the Actor in the
Actor-Concept-Instance triple is a Named Entity (NE) mention (person and
organization names), the Concept is an automatically generated topic descrip-
tion, not user-generated tags, and the Instance is a set of phrases with a high level
of speciﬁcity that frequently denote events (olympiad, demonstration, etc.). The
present paper considers the use of this modiﬁed tripartite model of ontologies
for the purposes of Internet Sociology studies.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a descrip-
tion of the three-layer model. Section 3 presents the experiments on real-world
data that include model construction, opinion mining and clustering. Section 4
concludes the paper. This paper outlines our pilot-study experiments performed
on the basis of Russian newspaper articles. The listed examples are translated
into English.

2 Multipartite Models

2.1 Tripartite Model

The tripartite model uses three layers of descriptors (keywords) for document
representation as follows. The ﬁrst layer is formed from a list of actors or person
and organization names that are mentioned in a document; the second layer is
a list of concepts that characterize the domain a given document belongs to;
the third layer is represented by the instances or document-speciﬁc collocations.
Each element of each list contains a set of tokens, which number varies from 1 to
5. As for a single document, the tripartite model can be created for a corpus of
documents. The corpus representation is a list of actors, concepts and instances
that are mentioned throughout a corpus. Table 1 presents an excerpt from a
model for a corpus of 250 documents related to the educational domain.

Here, the NE “Dr. Livanov” is a mention of the Russian Minister of Education
and Science. “Dr. Rukshin” is one of the leading Russian school teachers. Parlia-
ment means a discussion at the State Duma. President means here a discussion
at the Public Council under the President’s administration. Moscow means the
Department of Education of the Moscow Regional Government. It should be

noted that the frequency of occurrence of key terms in a document is not taken
into account when building the model. We focus on the presence or absence in
a document of the keywords from the corpus-based model.

2.2 Bipartite Model

The notation for the dimensionality of each layer (list) for the corpus of docu-
ments is as follows. Let Ka be the number of actors, Ki - the number of instances,
and Kc - the number of concepts.

Actors-Concepts model (AC model) shows what keywords each person or
organization is connected with in a text. It can be presented as a table (matrix)
of size M (Ka, Kc). Matrix transposition MT of size (Kc, Ka) will show the actors
that are related to a given concept (CA model).

The connection between an actor and a concept can be evaluated using the

Jaccard distance [6]:

J(Ai, Cj) = 2 × |DAi
|DAi

∩ DCj
∪ DCj

|
| ,

(1)

where Ai and Cj represent a speciﬁc actor and a concept respectively, DAi
and DCj correspond to the collections of documents, where the mentioned con-
cept and actor occur. The number of documents, where the given concept and
actor co-occur, in the numerator is doubled in order to normalize the connection
degree from [0.0, 1.0].

(cid:2)Kcj
i=1

(cid:2)Kaj
i=1

A weight WA for each actor on the concepts layer, and a weight WC for each
concept on the actors layer can be introduced as follows: WA =
J(Ai, Cj)
(Kcj is the number of concepts related to a speciﬁc actor, and J(Ai, Cj) is the
Jaccard distance between the selected actor and one of the related concepts) and
WC =
J(Ci, Aj) (Kaj is the number of actors related to a speciﬁc concept,
and J(Ci, Aj) is the Jaccard distance between the selected concept and one of
the related actors).

Concepts-Instances model (CI model) shows the speciﬁc collocations each
concept (keyword set) is related to and vice versa. The weights are introduced
in the same way as for the previous models. CI and IC models are commonly
used for natural language processing purposes in two-layer model-based docu-
ment parametrization: CI matrix shows the distribution of keywords throughout
the documents, and IC - speciﬁc expressions that are “spotted” in each of the
documents.The Instances-Actors (IA) and Actors-Instances (AI) models can be
built by transforming the previously obtained matrices: (AI) = (AC) × (CI)
and (IA) = (IC) × (CA).

2.3 Unipartite Model

Two-layer models can be reduced to single-layer models, which further allows
to perform automatic grouping. A one-layer model uses only one of the layers

326

M. Alexandrov et al.

or dimensions (actors, concepts or instances) for document and corpus repre-
sentation. In order to properly build the unipartite model, let us ﬁrst consider
the (AC) model, where we can ﬁnd the connections between two actors on the
concept layer. To this end, the calculation of the number of shared concepts for
each pair of actors should be performed. If all of the concepts are the same, the
connection will have its maximum weight, and if no concepts are shared, the
connection is insigniﬁcant. The connection can be evaluated using the Jaccard
distance as follows:

J(Ai, Aj) = 2 × |Kci ∩ Kcj|
|Kci ∪ Kcj| ,

(2)

where Ai and Aj are the corresponding actors, Kci and Kcj are sets of con-
cepts related to the actors Ai and Aj correspondingly. The number of shared
concepts in the numerator is doubled in order to normalize the connection degree
from [0.0, 1.0].

Having performed a pairwise evaluation of actors connection on the con-
cepts layer, we can build a matrix Actors - Actors (AA), which is the target
unipartite model. The resulting proximity matrix is the input for the cluster
analysis. As a result, we obtain the groups of interconnected actors. It is a
meaningful result: each cluster contains person and organization names discussed
within the same topics. In a similar way, the reversed (CA) matrix provides the
Concepts-Concepts model (CC). In this case, clustering also produces a meaning-
ful result: the connections between the concepts that share the same actors can
be seen. In a similar fashion, we obtain the matrices Concepts-Concepts (CC)
and Instances-Instances (II) from the bipartite (CI) model, and Actors-Actors
(AA) and Instances-Instances (II) from the bipartite Concepts-Instances model.
As it can be seen, (AA), (CC) and (II) matrices have been obtained twice. The
diﬀerence is that (AA) in one case reﬂects the connection between the actors on
the concept layer, and in the other case - on the instance layer, and similarly for
the matrices (CC) and (II).

3 Experiments

A corpus of 250 articles on education has been compiled for testing. We consider
this amount enough for a pilot study, because we can easily check the perfor-
mance of clustering and opinion measurement algorithms. An excerpt from an
article on education (translated) is given in Fig. 1. In this text we can ﬁnd the
elements belonging to the three layers: S. Rukshin, A. Kiryanov, D. Medvedyev
(Actors); Education (Concepts); gifted children, lyceums (Instances).

We consider two main operations on the obtained models: clustering (uni-
partite model) and opinion polarity analysis (tripartite and bipartite models).

3.1 Model Construction
Document models are built based on a corpus model, which includes 3 keyword
lists forming the actor, concept and instance dimensions. The corpus is created

A Modiﬁed Tripartite Model for Document Representation

using keyword-based queries, where the keywords cannot be randomly selected
and should represent a description of a certain topic. The three-layer model con-
struction includes two steps: (i) identify the descriptors (keywords and keyphases
denoting actors, concepts and instances within the given corpus) for each layer;
(ii) parametrize texts in the three dimensions.
Identiﬁcation of Descriptors

The extraction of actors and instances is a named entity recognition (NER)
task. As a solution, we extract single terms on the basis of their speciﬁcity cri-
terium using LexisTerm-I [2]. Term frequencies can be counted either in “Cor-
pus” mode for the whole corpus or in “Document” mode for each particular
document. In this implementation, LexisTerm-I proposes some candidates for
the construction of actor, instance and concept lists, and an expert does the
manual correction of the obtained list. At a later stage, we plan to make the
procedure totally automatic using approaches described in [8–10].
Actors List. The frequency of actors in the domain-speciﬁc documents is
assumed to be higher than in the general lexis, therefore, they are detected
in the “Document” mode. Our education-related corpus contains n = 50 actor
names, where there are 30 person names and 20 organization names. Each list
element includes 1–5 tokens, which allows to record full names with titles (e.g.,
Dr. Dmitry Livanov), and full organization names (e.g., Ministry of Science and
Education).
Concepts List. The terms have been extracted by LexisTerm-I for K = 10 in
the “Corpus” mode. Each concept in the resulting list includes one or several
words. The sample main concepts are as follows: education accessibility, young
talents, Uniﬁed State Exam, etc.. Within the “Education” domain we distinguish
M = 10 subtopics, for which keyword lists are manually created. The number
of descriptors cannot be higher than 20, which, from our experience, is enough.
The number of tokens per concept together with descriptors varies from 1 to 5.
Instances List. The instance list is constructed using the results of LexisTerm-
I text processing in the “Document” mode. Each instance is represented by 3
components: (i) an object or event; (ii) object/event location; (iii) object/event
date. The sample instances are the Law of Education, the decree on the creation
of a lyceum network, Moscow school merging, etc. There is also a ﬁxed list of
locations: Parliament, President’s Council, Moscow Government, etc. The date

328

M. Alexandrov et al.

includes the related month and year. The resulting list includes thus the following
components: [object1, object2, ...objectn], [location1, location2, ...locationn], and
(month, year). For our corpus, the list of objects and events contains P = 20
elements, the list of locations - Q = 15 elements. Each element’s length is of 1–5
tokens.
Document Parametrization

Document parametrization is the representation of a document in the three
dimensions of actors, concepts, and instances on the basis of the corpus model
performed with the ParamDoc-3D program. Operations on two dimensions are
performed in ParamDoc-2D, and on one dimension - in ParamDoc-1D [1]. The
base tripartite model is parametrized as follows.
Actor Dimension. All actor mentions from the N-actor list of the corpus model
in a document are collected. The actor mention is selected if it corresponds to
the expert-established settings. For unigrams, a complete match is obviously
required. In case of 2–5 token keywords, a complete or partial match (2-3 tokens)
can be set.
Concept Dimension. The weight of each topic in a document is measured using
a vocabulary of the corresponding descriptors. A topic with the highest weight, or
topics with the weights exceeding certain threshold are selected. The calculation
uses the following method [5]: (a) measure the text coverage by the vocabulary
(total density of the descriptors), (b) measure the vocabulary coverage by the
text (percentage of vocabulary entries’ mentions), (c) measure the total coverage.
Both coverages can take on a value [0.0, 5.1] using a non-linear scale. The total
value can range from 0 to 2. By establishing a threshold, we can sort out a set
of topics present in a document.
Instance Dimension. Instance extraction is done in 3 steps: (1) search for an
event or object from the list of P -instances of the corpus model, (2) search for
location triggers from the list of Q-locations of the corpus model, (3) search for
the mentions of month and year in the document body. Objects, events, and
locations are extracted similarly to actors: total and partial matches of the 1–5
token sets are considered. As for the date, texts often contain several mentions,
in which case at most 5 of them are extracted.

3.2 Opinion Mining

At the end of 2013 the Russian Federation authorities approved the Law of Edu-
cation. This event was preceded by a long evaluation of the contents of the Law
by the educational community, the Parliament and the Government. It was a
tough debate, due to the conﬂict between the market-driven and the traditional
approach to state education ﬁnancing in the country. We have performed the
opinion mining using GMDH [1,3] for the pairs from actor and instance dimen-
sions (Table 2).

It can be seen that the negative attitude was expressed mostly towards a
public organization (the Civic Chamber), and not towards the governmental

structures (Ministry of Education). It can be easily explained, because there are
many followers of unpopular reforms in the mentioned public organization.

3.3 Clustering
Clustering experiments have been carried out using the MajorClust method [7,
14] to group actors and instances in the concept dimension. Earlier, MajorClust
proved its eﬃciency in short texts processing [4,12]. The results are shown in
the Table 3.

The ﬁrst Actor cluster includes person and organization names related to
the topics “secondary school”, “gifted children”, “reforms ﬁnancing”. The sec-
ond cluster contains person and organization names, related to the topics “high
school”, “science”, “modeling”. The ﬁrst Instance cluster spans instances, related
to lawmaking, which are in turn related to the topics “secondary school” and
“gifted children”. The second cluster includes all the countries, where the author-
ities have been actively supporting young talents in the recent years (key phrases:
“gifted children”, “innovations”, “Asia”).

4 Conclusion and Future Work

The present paper describes a document representation model, based on the
tripartite model of ontologies by Peter Mika (Yahoo! Research), which can be
useful for the solution of Internet Sociology tasks. The results of a pilot exper-
iment are presented. Information on the deployment of the developed tools is
provided. As the future work, we plan to do the following:
– Investigate the behaviour of the proposed model in more detail. To this end:

• Evaluate the proposed model on a larger corpus;
• Perform clustering in the actor and instance dimensions;
• Perform document parametrization automatically;
• Visualize the results so that they can be easily interpreted.

– Develop the necessary tools that will allow to:
